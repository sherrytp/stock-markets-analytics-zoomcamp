## Module 3 Homework

In this homework, we're going to work with categorical variables, first ML models (Decision Trees), and hyperparameters tuning.

If not stated otherwise, please use the [Colab Module 3](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/stock-markets-analytics-zoomcamp/blob/main/02-dataframe-analysis/Module2_Colab_Working_with_the_data.ipynb) covered at the livestream to re-use the code snippets.
